# Pseudocode
A collection of clear and structured pseudocode for common algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques. Designed for quick reference, learning, and interview prep. Perfect for students, coders brushing up on fundamentals, or anyone who wants logic without the syntax baggage.
# Pseudocode Playground 🧠

A random collection of pseudocode I’ve written for fun.  
No strict syllabus, no real syntax — just logic and vibes.

Made as a way to mess around with algorithms, ideas, and weird logic puzzles without committing to a full programming language.

## ✨ Why?

- Helps me think through problems before coding
- Clean way to visualize logic
- Sometimes you just wanna write... fake code

## 📁 Stuff I’ve thrown in here

- Random algorithms
- Silly problem-solvers
- Mini simulations
- Anything I felt like breaking down logically

## 🚧 Note

None of this is meant to run — it’s just structure and flow.  
Treat it like digital whiteboard scribbles.
